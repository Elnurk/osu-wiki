# Rhythm

**Rhythm** is "the pattern of sound, silence, and emphasis in a song" [[1]][r]. When creating [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap), mappers pay attention to where sounds land in the music to determine where to place [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_object) and [hitsounds](/wiki/Beatmapping/Hitsound), in order to follow the rhythm and emphasise certain parts of it. Being a rhythm game, rhythm is an intrinsic part of any beatmap in osu!.
