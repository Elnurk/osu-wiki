## Challenge: Chromatic Alteration {#challenge}

**The colour palettes of all skin submissions must be limited to the visible spectrum of the following types of colour vision deficiencies**:

- **Protanopia**
- **Deuteranopia**
- **Tritanopia**

Bear in mind that your skin must feature **only one** of these colour spectra. Additionally, while shades of grey are contained in these palettes, your skin must not be primarily grayscale.

Shown above are the spectra and example colour palettes for the three colour vision deficiencies mentioned prior in relation to normal colour vision. These spectra are based on normal colour vision at full saturation and brightness.
